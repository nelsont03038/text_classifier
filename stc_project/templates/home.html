    <h3>Simple Text Classifier</h3>
    <p><p><p>
    This application allows you to upload your labeled training data and train
    a text classification model.  After model training, you will be presented with
    relevant model training performance metrics.  You will also be able to use the
    model to classify arbitrary text that you enter in a form.  Under the hood, the
    application uses a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
    <p><p><p>
    The training data needs to be formatted as a tab delimited text file
    where both label_i and text_i are arbitrary text like this:
    <p><p><p>
    label_1 \t text_1 \n<br>
    label_2 \t text_2 \n<br>
    â€¦<br>
    label_n \t text_3 \n<br>
  </div>

  <h3>Upload the training data</h3>
  Only click "Train Model" once.  Processing could take a long time on a large dataset.
  Small data sets (about 1000 lines of text such as the restaurant review sentiment
  analysis sample data) take a few seconds to process.  Larger data sets (tens of thousands
  of lines of text such as the spooky author classification sample data) take a few
  minutes to process.
