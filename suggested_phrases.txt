To test the classifier trained on the restaurant review sentiment data, try text like this:

positive = the "positive" class means the sentiment is positive
"The food was great.  The waiter was awesome, the desert is the best."
"Simply amazing!  The food was great, the waitress was friendly."

negative = the "negative" class means the sentiment is negative
"The food here was awful, I hated it.  I'll never go back again!"
"The waiter was rude.  The food was cold.  The atmosphere was boring."


To test the classifier trained on the spooky author data, try text like this:

HP Lovecraft
"Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars." 

Edgar Allen Poe
"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;"

Mary W Shelley
"The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends."
